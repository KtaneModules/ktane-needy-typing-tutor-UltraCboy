  title: Needy Typing Tutor
  author: UltraCboy
  description: "My first proper new mod release in nearly three years, and it's another
    needy.\n\nThis is the Typing Tutor. The goal of it is simple: type the word displayed
    on the screen. But if there's no keyboard in sight on this module, how are you
    going to type? Simple: use your own keyboard. Don't worry if you don't have your
    own keyboard, this mod can be configured to change that. Information on how to
    do so is provided in the manual.\n\n\rIf you have any issues or suggestions, your
    best bet is to contact me on Discord, either through DMs or through the KTANE
    Discord server. My username is UltraCboy#4639.\r\n\r\nModule ID: needyTypingTutor\nManual
    Page: Available in the build folder, will eventually be available at ktane.timwi.de\n\nThank
    you, and happy defusing!"
